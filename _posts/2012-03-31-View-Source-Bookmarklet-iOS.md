[How to “View Source” from Safari on an iPad or iPhone][link] from [Ole Michelsen][dk]:

1. Add this (or any other) page as a bookmark
2. Then [click here to see the bookmarklet code][code] and Select All → Copy
3. Now edit that same bookmark, paste the code you just copied into the URL and name it something like “View Source”

This will most certainly be used. Thanks Ole!

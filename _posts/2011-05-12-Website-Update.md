Instead of working on [My Everyday Things project][metp] last night I spent over two hours captivated by slide decks from [Note &amp; Point][np]. That _small_ diversion led me to rethink the font I was using on this site...and once I started thinking about fonts it was all over.

After hours and hours (and hours) of dinking around I decided to try [Google's web fonts][google] versus me hosting them. We'll see how that goes...it slightly goes against the [simplicity][text] that I am after with this site, but I still feel compelled to try.

I am using [Metrophobic][] for the main text, [Francois One][fo] for the headers, and [Waiting for the Sunrise][sunrise] for the title (Brandon Bohling)...which coincidentally is nearly identical to how I write. I think it is a big improvement...hopefully you agree. Which brings me to another change. Instead of using a _Comment via Twitter_ link, which broke recently due to a Twitter change...I am now using their official button. This will only be displayed on single post pages.

The third and finally change I made was to now display the last five posts on the home page versus just one. I guess I've procrastinated enough now. This weekend I __will__ post my first project post. Really. Seriously.

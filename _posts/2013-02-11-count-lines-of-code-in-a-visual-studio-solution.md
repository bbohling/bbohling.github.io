At work I was wading through a very old code base and was curious how many lines of code it contained. Not wanting to open the seemingly endless list of files in the solution, I went looking for a quick-n-dirty way to count the lines of code in the solution. Preferring a command-line approach than installing a utility that I would likely rarely use, I found this simple powershell snippet:

    (dir -include *.cs,*.cpp,*.h,*.idl,*.asmx -recurse | select-string .).Count
    

Note: you will want to navigate to the solutionâ€™s directory first, then execute the command above.

I have a Japanese Maple outside my (home)
office window. For about a week now I have noticed the morning sun
illuminating its beautiful limbs, buds, morning (more like all day) dew.
Each day I would say to myself, “I should capture that moment with my
camera (Canon EOS 20D).” I finally did or at least I finally *attempted*
to, I’m hoping you will let me know what you think of the outcome. I
would love to capture a three to five photo series. I don’t think I’ve
got it yet, but thought I would see what you thought. Below are four
photos that I took relatively quickly. I know they are small images, but
not everyone has broadband access, so I try to be considerate to the
handicapped. No offense meant.

![Japanese Maple Series 1][1]

![Japanese Maple Series 2][2]

![Japanese Maple Series 3][3]

![Japanese Maple Series 4][4]

Which ones (if any) do you like? 

**[update]** While I respect the comments I have received so far and I do agree that normally series are
not all the same (or very similar shots)…I’m daring to be different. Let me try to explain…I’m striving for a three photo series that upon first
glance looks like identical (or nearly identical) photos. This should intrigue the viewer to take a closer look—at least that’s my hope. And
when they do look closer they will start to notice differences…maybe some obvious ones, but some slight ones as well. Remember the
[Hocus-Focus 2–panel cartoon in the comics](http://www.suck.com/daily/2001/06/01/)—that’s what I’m after.

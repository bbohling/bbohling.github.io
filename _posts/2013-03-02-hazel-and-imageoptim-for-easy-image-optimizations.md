[ImageOptim][io] is a fantastic utility to reduce the size of your images without impacting image quality[^fn-1]. I use it both for my web and iOS work, but it was not until today that I made it even better.


## My Old Workflow

1.  Save whatever image I was working on to some folder
2.  Open ImageOptim
3.  Drag the image onto ImageOptim canvas
4.  ImageOptim does its work
5.  I move the optimized image to its final destination

## My New Workflow

1.  Save whatever image I was working on to an “optimize” folder
2.  Hazel automatically moves to an “optimized” folder
3.  Hazel automatically kicks off ImageOptim and it optimizes the image
4.  I move the optimized image to its final destination

My responsibilities went from four steps to two; a 50% reduction. I will admit that it only saves me a minute or so each time, but I am all about reducing inefficiencies and friction in my life right now. In addition, because I was testing image quality vs. file size of various screenshot apps ([Pixa][4], [Little Snapper][5], and [Voila][6]) I already saved myself at least 30 minutes.


With a little bit more work I could simplify or even remove the final step. Example: step 4 could be easy and fast by leveraging [Dropzone][7]. Simply drag the optimized image to a *dropzone* and it will place it in the appropriate directory, upload to a site, attach to an email, etc.


[^fn-1]: The image used in this post was reduced 45% to 137KB.

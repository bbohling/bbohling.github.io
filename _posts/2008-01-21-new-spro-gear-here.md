![La Spaziale MiniVivali II](/uploads/2008/01/LaSpazialeMiniVivali2.jpg)

I only have a few minutes before lunch is over, but had to share...my
new espresso machine and grinder finally arrived. After three weeks of
no spro at home, relief is finally here. I will post much more (first
impressions, videos, and more photos) in the next few days, but just had
to share my joy.

These photos aren't great, but I'm racing to get everything setup over
lunch so I can have play time tonight! Again, will post more shortly.

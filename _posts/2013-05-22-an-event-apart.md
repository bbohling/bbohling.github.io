![AEA San Diego](/uploads/2013/05/AEASanDiego.jpg)

I just spent the last few days in sunny San Diego. Instead of enjoying the outdoor activities though, I was in a large room with hundreds of other people learning about the latest in standards-based web design. The conference, [An Event Apart](http://aneventapart.com) (AEA), had twelve top-notch speakers including [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Zeldman) and [Eric Meyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Meyer) who started the conference. In my 18 years of being a professional *web guy* I have been to many conferences, but without a doubt AEA was my favorite...even better than [WWDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wwdc). The mix of designers and developers was refreshing and given the limited number of attendees (~400) it was easy to talk with many. There were no "tracks", simply one room, so no making tough choices on which sessions to attend. And the content. __Not a single session was a snore fest.__ All the speakers presented beautifully engaging slides, sharing knowledge and best practices through stories, something I rarely experience in my day job.

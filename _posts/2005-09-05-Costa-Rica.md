![Delicious Breakfast in Costa Rica](/uploads/2005/09/0620422427_200509_20D_10939.jpg)

I just returned from a six day trip to Costa Rica. Unfortunately it was for work so I did not have much free time. However, I did manage to set aside some time for photography. In the next week I will work on posting a gallery&hellip;though I should work on an Alaska gallery considering that trip was months ago. I did post several photos from Costa Rica on my photo blog though: [http://blog.digitalbohling.com](http://blog.digitalbohling.com/), so make sure you visit that site. In the meantime,&nbsp;I did create a Costa Rica wallpaper (updated 2011.02.27 - cannot find wallpaper) if you are interested.

![iPhone 4S](/uploads/2012/05/20120524-IMG_0059.jpg "iPhone 4S")

Nearly two years ago I wrote about how the [iPhone greatly impacted the usage of my Canon 5D Mark II][iphone]. A quick summary: the iPhone camera got to be so good that I used it instead of my DSLR not only because of the photo quality but because of how easy it was then to post photos online. Fortunately technology changes.

## Canon 5D Mark III + Eye-Fi = AWESOMENESS

I have had my eye on the [Eye-Fi][eye-fi] for years. It is a memory card that has a built-in wi-fi that allows for uploading your photos while shooting (either via [wi-fi][basics] or [direct mode][direct-mode]). Unfortunately, because the Eye-Fi is an SD card and my Canon 5D Mark II only used compact flash (CF) cards I was out of luck[^fn-adapter]. That is why I got so excited when the [Canon 5D Mark III was announced][announcement] and it was revealed that an SD slot was present...and not only that but had the ability to write to both a CF and SD card simultaneously. Giddy Up! This meant I could still have my hi-res RAW images written to the CF card, but in addition have lower-res JPG images on an Eye-Fi, which would then wirelessly sync to one or more destinations. 

This week I received my Canon 5D Mark III and tested my theory...and I am happy to say it works! Regardless if I am shooting at home or in some remote destination I can take photos with my DSLR and sync[^fn-sync] them to either my iPad or iPhone (or both) and then if I have some sort of Internet connection, can post the photos online. Yes, not quite as simple as snapping a photo with an iPhone then immediately posting, but the quality I get with the DSLR is so much better that the additional step is well worth it.

## Field Testing

At this point I have only been testing my workflow for a couple of days, shooting about 70 shots and posting less than a dozen of them. However, we have a big road trip planned for the 3-day weekend so I will be heavily field testing the workflow. Upon my return I will describe it in more detail. I will be posting between [Twitter][twit] and [Google+][gplus] if you want to follow along.

[^fn-adapter]: Yes, there are [adapters][adapters] that technically allow this setup, but they always get horrible reviews. Mainly because the adapter hinders the wi-fi strength.
[^fn-sync]: The sync happens automatically...no manual intervention required.

Sometimes we all need a little bit of inspiration to motivate us to be productive. Recently I have leveraged two sources for finding some fantastic photography for inspiration: [Google+][google] and [500px][500px].

## Google+

The big two social networks have a very fine grain purpose for me...Twitter to keep tabs with technology and Facebook to communicate with a few friends and family members. The newest kid on the block, Google+[^fn-google], currently is my favorite place to find inspiring photos. Below are a few people that I have added to my photographers circle:

* [Thomas Leuthard][brndn]
* [Ben Canales][brndn 2]
* [Matt Veldey][brndn 3]
* [Chris McLennan][brndn 4]

## 500px

Tired of the crap on Flickr? Check out the amazing photos posted on 500px. Every night I try to spend a few minutes going through the [popular photos][500px 2]. Amazing and very inspirational. A few photographers that I follow:

* [William Church][500px 3]
* [Agne Bruziene][500px 4]
* [Cornel Pufan][500px 5]
* [Aaron Reed][500px 6]

## Inspiration Outcome

Ben Canales, that I mentioned above, has really inspired me to take some photos at night. Unfortunately, living in the Northwest, I am finding it particularly difficult to get a clear night at this time of year. After my first attempt though I captured the photo below. I have a LONG ways to go before I get to Ben's level, but I can't wait to see what my 99th attempt will look like!

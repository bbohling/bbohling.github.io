This has been a big week of knocking down the [Jekyll][jekyll] publishing barriers. [Automating the Jekyll publishing process][auto] was the first big one. As I stated in [that post][auto], it still is not perfect, but much, much better than the default Jekyll _behavior_. Next, I tweaked Jekyll so I could publish [link posts][linkposts], but what good is that feature unless I can publish them lickety-split? Luckily I remembered that [Ben Brooks][ben] [posted on this topic][benhow] recently (turns out it was just over a year ago). 

This is the macro I came up with taking [Ben's lead][benhow]:

## The Workflow

When I am viewing a web page in Safari that I want to link to I do the following:

1. Highlight any text I want to quote.
2. Hit my Keyboard Maestro hot key to launch the _Link Post_ macro

That is it. After using the above 2 steps I got the following link post _start_ for my first link post, [How to find the hidden files on Mac OS X][howto]:

Again, this is not perfect. Currently the macro is for Safari only. I also use Google Chrome (though mostly for Flash-based sites) so I need to create a Chrome-specific macro. Or better yet (if possible), tweak the macro to copy the relevant info of whichever browser is in the foreground. Hopefully someone much smarter than me will post a solution. Let the online discussions begin!

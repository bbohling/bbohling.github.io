Several years ago one of my fellow photographers, [Cecil Walker](http://www.cecilwalker.com/ "check out cecil walkers website"), showed me an easy, but priceless photo editing tip. I wish one of us could take credit for this, but unfortunately we can’t—nonetheless I’m glad Cecil came across the article. I’m sorry I do not remember where, so apologies to the original “founder”. All photographers, on occasion (ha), take a flat photo…I know, shocking. With a quick 2–step tweak the flat photo can be reborn into the image you really witnessed. I use this tip so much that I created two Photoshop actions. And to be honest I don’t think I’ve processed a photo in the last 2+ years that I did not use this tip. 

**Step 1: Clarify** In a photo editor that supports Unsharp Mask (USM) use these values:

-   Amount: 20%
-   Radius: 60 pixels
-   Threshold: 4

**Step 2: Sharpen** In a photo editor that supports Unsharp Mask (USM) use these values:

-   Amount: 500%
-   Radius: 0.2 pixels
-   Threshold: 0

**Using Clarify/Sharpen** After you create an “action” for these two steps use them in the following manner:

1.  Complete all your photo editing (including image resizing)
2.  Apply Clarify one or more times (for this sample I applied it once,
    but when I’m printing I may execute the action multiple times)
3.  Apply Sharpen one or more time (again, depending on your output you
    may need to apply more than once)

**Photoshop Action** For those that use Photoshop you can download the following ZIP file and extract to your Photoshop directory Presets\Photoshop Actions 

>example: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS2\Presets\Photoshop Actions

**[update 2011.02.27]** unfortunately the samples and the Photoshop actions have been vaporized due to multiple website *moves*.

In a previous post, [What Would You Buy First?][buy-first], I highlight the apps I would buy first if I had to start all over today. In this post I will outline the apps I will be installing on a new MacBook Air that arrives today. One data point to note: I am cutting my drive space in half (to 256GB), so this list may be slightly different if it were  a new iMac.

## Critical Apps

The following apps are the must-have apps. Apps so crucial to me that I can't stand to use a system without them. All were on my [previous list][buy-first]. 

* [Dropbox][dropbox] - duh
* [1Password][1Password] - manage all passwords, credit card info, and other super secret stuff
* [Aperture][] - photo management and editing
* [Reeder][] - RSS reader
* [FontCase][] - manage my font fetish
* [Acorn][] - cheap, lightweight image editor (I no longer use Adobe Photoshop even though I have CS5). I own Pixelmator too, but prefer the Acorn interface.
* [Alfred][] - launcher/productivity app
* [TextExpander][] - excellent timesaver, just get it
* [SuperDuper!][] - create full, bootable backups
* [Transmit][] - FTP client
* [TextMate][] - robust text editor. However, if no updates to TextMate come out within a month or so I will switch back to [BBEdit][].

## New to the list:

* [nvALT][alt] - how did I forget this in my original post!? This is my virtual notebook/scratch paper.
* XCode - I doubt I do any heavy development on the MacBook Air, but I do need XCode to easily take advantage of some dev platforms.
* [Keyboard Maestro][km] - this app receives much praise from most of the tech bloggers I follow. I will admit though, I am not taking advantage of this app nearly enough.
* [Byword][] - I go back and forth between writing using Byword and iA Writer...currently I am using Byword more and is what I used to write this post.
* [Final Cut Pro X][fcp] - because iMovie just doesn't have enough features for my 1 video I create a year.
* [Cloud App][]: I switching from Droplr to Cloud app recently because Droplr didn't work so well switching between my home and corporate networks. [AppStorm posted a comparison][clouds] if you'd like to decide for yourself. 
* [Marked][] - I use markdown for all my writing, even my notes, so it's great to get an HTML preview regardless of the software I am using to write.

## The _maybe_ list:

I use all of these apps today on a regular basis. However, in most cases they aren't absolutely necessary so I will use the MacBook Air as long as I can without them...we'll see how long I last.

* [Sparrow][] - Gmail client. I will once again try Mail.app (Lion version this time), but if I continue to not like it I will switch back to Sparrow.
* [OmniFocus][] - manage my tasks. I currently use OmniFocus mainly for work and since the MacBook Air is a personal system I doubt I will install. Even if I start capturing personal tasks with OmniFocus I could use the iPhone or iPad version instead.
* [OmniGraffle][] - draw pretty pictures (I'm a software architect). Like OmniFocus, I use OmniGraffle mainly for work. I have OmniGraffle for the iPad too, so I doubt I install this on the MacBook Air...at least to start.
* [LittleSnapper][] - take/manage screenshots. I will see if I can live with the built-in screenshot capabilities plus Acorn.
* [iA Writer][ia] - Byword alternate

## Other

The following items are mainly to support my blogging.

* [Jekyll][] - a text-base blogging engine that I use for this website.
* [Ruby][] - pre-requisite for Jekyll. I have a draft post on this install process, but since I haven't posted it yet Mike Clark has good instructions: [Installing Ruby 1.9 and Rails on Mac OS X][ruby-install].
* [Pandoc][] - I have been meaning to write about this lovely piece of software for a long time. I use it A TON.
* [Haskell][] - Pandoc was written using Haskell

Any time I get a new system I have the best intentions of keeping it clean. Within a month though I have dozens of apps that I installed, used maybe once, and has since collected test. Now that I think about it, maybe I need to start using [Hazel][] again. It is the perfect tool to get rid of things that you are ignoring...kind of like having a maid for your computer. Regardless, I will track all my installs (which is getting easier with the Mac App Store) and provide an update in a month or so.

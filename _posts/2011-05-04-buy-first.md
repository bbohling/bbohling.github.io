Today [Ben Brooks][bb] posted his [list of apps][apps] he would buy first if he had to start all over again. So why not join in on that fun?

My list of apps I would __buy__ first:

* [Dropbox][] - duh
* [Backblaze][] - backup computer and 2 Drobos
* [1Password][] - manage all passwords
* [Aperture][] - photo management and editing
* [OmniFocus][] - manage my tasks
* [OmniGraffle][] - draw pretty pictures (I'm a software architect)
* [Sparrow][] - Gmail client
* [Reeder][] - RSS reader
* [TextMate][] - robust text editor
* [FontCase][] - manage my font fetish
* [LittleSnapper][] - take/manage screenshots
* [Acorn][] - cheap, lightweight image editor (I no longer use Adobe Photoshop even though I have CS5)

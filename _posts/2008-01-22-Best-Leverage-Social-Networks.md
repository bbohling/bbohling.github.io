For years I have been developing my own web sites and hosting my own content (text, photos, and videos). I guess I took this approach mainly so I would have full control over everything...us developers can be a little power hungry at times. Sometimes I have different sites (URLs) with specific content for each and sometimes I cram everything together, but before I go into any further details, let's look at some of the purposes of my
site(s). 

**Types of content I post to the world:**

* Semi-pro photos (a gallery), that I share and potentially sell
* Daily photos of our son, Bryce
* A blog that covers my interests: photography, food/wine/espresso (sustenance), and technology
* Videos of Bryce and my other interests (eventually some training on those interests)

Our current site is back to cramming everything together (read: [How We Got Here][] for more background) though I have not yet really posted any
semi-pro photos, nor have I done a whole lot with videos yet. Someday I will take the time to port over the years with of content that I have
posted previously. The one topic (and the point of this post) I have not yet reconciled is where to host the content, specifically photos. Due to
the size of videos I am convinced that hosting them on a social network site like [YouTube][] or [Vimeo][] is best...and for me that means
Vimeo due to its superior quality (I can post [HD videos][]). In addition, blog content makes sense to keep within your blog software
(Blogger, WordPress, etc.) or Content Management System (CMS), again I am using [ExpressionEngine][4] for this site. However, those
pesky little photos are another story. Currently I am hosting all of our photos within my own site (ExpressionEngine), again mainly for full
control. However, the idea of embedding them in my site from a social network like [Flickr][] does intrigue me a great deal. I hope this post
will generate some online discussion with folks like [Ken][] who has [tried both ways][]. Let's take at my initial attempt at some pros and
cons. Hopefully this list will grow as some discussions occur. 

**Pros of Leveraging a Social Network site (like Flickr):**

* Photos will get more exposure (though Ken states otherwise in his post, [Migrating off Flickr (partially)][])
* Add metadata to photos only once in software (I use Aperture, but many similar products available)
* Ability to reuse same photos (and metadata) for multiple sites
* Allow people (in my case family and friends) to order prints themselves instead of printing myself and then sending to people
* Provides an additional backup if the multiple backups that I have at home get destroyed

**Cons of Leveraging a Social Network site (like Flickr):**

* No control over photo sizes (I would have to slightly change the design of this site to allow for larger photos)
* Seems like photos on social network sites are more likely to be used without permission. I do not have scientific proof of this, but I read about more instances of photos being "stolen" from Flickr than personal web sites.
* When viewers want to see a larger version they are taken away from my own site
* Viewers may choose to track my social network presence rather than my web site which sort of defeats the purpose of having a site in the first place.

OK, I admit this is just a conversation starter. I really want to put
more time and thought into this, but between getting [my new espresso gear][spro] today, work, and dealing with a sick little boy this is all I
have time for at the moment. Please leave your thoughts and/or provide me links to your blog posts on this topic. I'd love to start a virtual
conversation (among various blogs) about this topic.

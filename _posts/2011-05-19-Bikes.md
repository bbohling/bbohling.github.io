Bikes have always played a large part in my life. I vividly remember each bike all the way back to my first [Big Wheel][bigwheel][^fn-1]...one of the [originals][] in the early 70s. The first monumental bike purchase for me occurred in 1982. For a year I had been working on my parents and grandparents to buy me a [Honda three wheeler][atv]. I was totally consumed with the idea of having my own three wheeler...my cousin had three Honda ATVs which I loved to ride anytime we went to his house. Just as everyone was about to break down and buy me an ATV the movie [E.T.][et] came out. Remember how cool all the bike scenes were? Well, my tune changed...now I wanted a [Kuwahara][bmx] more than anything else. 

I think I could get amnesia, forget the name of all my friends and family (even my own) and I would still remember this moment. My parents and grandparents asked me if I was sure I wanted a BMX...OR would I  rather have a three wheeler. Yes, they were actually (finally) prepared to buy me a three wheeler! Whoa. This should be an easy choice, right?  After all, I already had a BMX bike (though a 2 ton brick of a bike), so, logically it made more sense to get an ATV. Then again, when do 12 year olds act logically? Without any hesitation at all I whole heartily stated I wanted a Kuwahara BMX bike. My parents and grandparents were no fools when it came to figuring out the financial consequence of my choice so that very day I had a shiny, chrome Kuwahara with white and blue lettering. It was gorgeous. I rode that bike throughout my middle school and high school years. And I can honestly say that to this day I do not regret my decision. If for no other reason than I surely would have hospitalized myself (if not worse) if I had a three wheeler at age 12.

Certainly my memories of the Kuwara do not end there. My most memorable moment with that bike was when my friend and I built a ramp from a sawhorse and sheet of plywood. What I quickly learned about our choice in materials, as I hit the plywood, was the _springiness_ of a sheet of plywood. I was launched halfway to the moon but fortunately landed upright without crashing (or hurting my man parts). However, I landed with such force that I blew out both tires. And while this is one of many similar stories I have with that bike, I never once ended up in the hospital. Well, at least not until I was an adult (a story for another post). 

Since then, I've had quite a few bike and while I love them all and could share many stories[^fn-2] it wasn't until the end of 2010 that I had my next monumental bike purchase.

When we moved from Arizona to Oregon in 2005 I transitioned from mountain bike rider to roadie[^fn-3] which I thought I would never do. I mean us mountain bikers were laid back, flannel wearing, cool kids...unlike those uptight, outfit matching, snob roadies! All it took though was a single ride with a group of local cyclists, blazing around the beautiful country side in Forest Grove and I was hooked. The first road bike I got was quickly upgraded the very next year. Not wanting to continue that horribly expensive trend I looked at cheap (at least that was the original intent) alternatives. I started getting computers and gizmos for my bike to aid in improving my performance...I was getting tired of getting left behind. Well, like most [things I do][spro] I got carried away. 

_A little sidebar to explain how I function..._

I am very competitive...especially when it comes to athletics. I was a cross country runner during my high school and college years. And while I do some competitive running and cycling today, I really like competing with myself on a day-to-day basis and my favorite way to do that is with data. Unfortunately, simply writing down my workouts is not good enough. I want technology involved. I want data collected automatically. This is why, when I bought a [trainer][] to train indoors I wasn't satisfied for very long. Not only was I highly restricted on the data I could collect, it was completely manual.

_And so..._

One thing led to another and soon I was determined that I needed the [CycleOps 400 Pro][400pro]. The amount of data the 400 Pro collects is insane. Totally for a pro, which I clearly am not. However, the geek in me won out in the end (read: miraculously convinced Denise) and I purchased the state-of-the-art machine. Months later I am still learning how to best leverage all the data. I also just recently spent another small fortunate on a setup that allows me to collect data from all my outdoor rides that I can now mimic indoors on the 400 Pro. In other words, any ride that I do on my outdoor road bike I can duplicate on the 400 Pro. You have to admit (geek/jock or not), that is so awesome, right!? 

To wrap up this WAY-TOO-LONG post on my history with bikes, I'd like to point out maybe the most important fact: my mom and dad still have my Kuwahara, which I intend on giving to Bryce in a year or two. Let the fun begin!

[^fn-2]: Just to name a few: Crashing going down _The Waterfall_ on South Mountain (ER visit), getting hit by a car while riding my 3 day old bike, and falling off my bike into a bunch of cacti requiring Denise to pull [spines][] out from __all__ conceivable places.

![My Canon Lenses](/uploads/2011/10/20111029-CanonLenses.jpg)

Not that I am an expert, but I often get asked photography related questions. A commonly asked question: *What lens should I buy?* Of course, there is not a single answer for everyone. I do have a single, initial response though: *Buy the best lens you can afford* [^fn-afford]. I have had many camera bodies, but for the most part have had the same lenses since 2001, so consider your lens purchase a long-term investment. Of course this is just a general rule and has caveats. Example: if you have an entry level DSLR like the [Canon EOS 1100D](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/slrs/canon_eos1100d) it simply is not built to have a [Canon EF 400mm f/2.8L IS](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/lenses/canon_400_2p8l_is_ii_usm) attached to it[^fn-build].

Before I provide further advice I shoot back a question: _What do you want to shoot?_ Their response allows me to provide the best advice from my personal experience[^fn-opinion]. Keep in mind though that at the end of the day, it still is all a matter of opinion. 

## Landscape

This was my entry into DSLR photography. At the time I lived in Arizona and had access to spectacular destinations like the Grand Canyon, Antelope Canyon, Monument Valley, Sedona, Sonoran Desert, etc. At the beginning I only had a Sigma 20mm, but now I'd recommend the following given what I have owned.

## People

It wasn't until Bryce was born in 2006 that I really started shooting portraits. Though I never owned the 85mm, I had a friend that lent me one and it was a fantastic lens...it took a LOT of practice to use accurately though. I currently own the 100mm and absolutely __love__ the lens. It probably is on my camera 80% of the time.

## Travel

This is a tough category given the wide range of objectives. The safe bet is to use the 24-70mm, but it is also the most _boring_ in my opinion. The 24-105mm gives you a broader range, but you have to consider the limitation of the smaller aperture. If your goal is street photography or you want to capture photos in _stealth mode_ than the 50mm is a great lens for the money.

[Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/lenses/canon_50_1p4)

## Action

If you are trying to capture a sporting event then you probably want something like the 70-200mm, but if are simply trying to capture a fast-moving pet or child then the 100mm will fit the bill.

## Macro 

Though the 100mm is the only true macro lens I used the 70-200mm for many years as my macro lens. Even the 50mm can be used as a pseudo macro lens.

[Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/lenses/canon_70-200_2p8_is_ii)

[Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/lenses/canon_50_1p4)

## Best Bang for the Buck

If you have a tight budget and can only buy one lens I would highly recommend buying the 50mm f/1.4. Even though it is an older lens, it still is a phenomenal lens given the price point.

Some may wonder about the [Canon EF 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 II USM](http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/lenses/canon_28-105_3p5-4p5_ii). In the past this lens, by many, was considered a fantastic all-around lens. Having personally owned the lens, I can say it was subpar. I couldn't stand the variable aperture and the soft photos it created. I admit, given my arsenal of pro lenses, may have higher standards than most, but would rather have a prime lens (which is typically cheaper) like the 50mm. Again, all of the above advice is based on my own personal experience. I welcome input.

[^fn-build]: I do not know this to be fact, but is an assumption given the lighter weight build quality

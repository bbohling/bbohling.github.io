This post is testing a new feature that I have added to my Jekyll workflow. I have created an Automator workflow (that is actually a folder action) that assists in auto publishing my blog posts. This new setup not only removes steps in my blogging workflow, but also allows me to post from my iOS devices as well. Additionally, I am testing the use of dictation on my iPad to see if it will further reduce the barriers of blogging.

Unfortunately I cannot go into details right now, but will share my learnings soon. This will include an update to setting up Jekyll on Lion. My previous post, [Installing Jekyll on Mac OS X](/2011/08/Installing-Jekyll-on-Mac "Installing Jekyll on Mac OS X"), is already dated after the Lion and latest Xcode releases.

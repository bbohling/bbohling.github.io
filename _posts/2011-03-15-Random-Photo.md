![Photo by Brandon Bohling](/uploads/2011/03/20110206-IMG_1130.jpg)

From time to time I will post a random photo. I chose this photo not only because I like it but also how surprised I was to capture it...

It was just an average weekend afternoon hanging out at home. We were sitting down for lunch at our kitchen table and I took note of the [amaryllis][] (aka naked lady) on our table. I liked how the light from the front door was in the background. And as luck would have it, my Canon 5D Mark II was sitting there with the macro lens, [100mm f/2.8L Macro IS][macro], on it. 

The experience was a reminder that great photos are everywhere...even in our normal, everyday lives.

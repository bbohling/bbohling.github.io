title:  "Deploying Angular Using http-server, Nginx, and PM2"
categories:

Since it took about an hour to put all the pieces together correctly I thought it best to document how I deployed an [Angular][ng2] (version 2) app using [http-server][http], [pm2][pm], and nginx. In my case I deployed to an Ubuntu server hosted on [DigitalOcean][do], but these instructions should work the same as long as you have the other components installed correctly.

I am not an expert on this topic. Like most people, I am learning as I go. If you think I am doing something stupid please let me know.

## Pre-reqs

Let's get the easy stuff out of the way...

### http-server

First, I installed http-server to serve my Angular app. I already had node/npm installed on my remote server, so I simply ran the follow command and was done.

```shell
npm install http-server -g
```

### Angular

I used the [angular-cli][ng-cli] to create an app. When the app was done[^fn-1], I created a build using:

```shell
ng build -prod
```

After the build was complete, I copied the contents of the `dist/` directory to my remote server. Easy part, done.

## Nginx

I am going to assume that the only reason you have made it this far is because you already have nginx installed on your server.

Nginx requires a [server block][nginx-blocks] for the Angular app so for me, this meant adding a file to the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory on my remote server. I am running multiple web sites so I created a new file called: `ng2.cooldomain.com`. Before I forgot, I also created a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:

```shell
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ng2.cooldomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ng2.cooldomain.com
```

This is the configuration I ended up with[^fn-2]:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ng2.cooldomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

**Two points of interest:**

1. You may use an IP address or some other convention for the `server_name` depending on your setup.
1. Depending on how you serve (e.g., different port) the Angular app you may have a different `proxy_pass` as well.

**Pro Tip** two commands to remember when messing with nginx: `sudo nginx -t` will test your configuration and run `sudo service nginx restart` after saving changes.

## PM2

Finally, I wanted to use pm2 to keep the new Angular site up and running. Over time I have created a collection of apps. Executing a pm2 command each time I finished an app has not been a big deal. Knowing if something goes wrong I would have to start them all again however is a different story. I went looking for a way to configure all the apps in a single config file. Of course pm2 has such a feature and I found the [Application declaration][pm-config] documentation. Below are the important bits, including a snippet for another app just to demonstrate how you can configure multiple apps. I added the JSON below in a file called `process.json`.

```json
{
    "apps": [
        {
            "name": "angular",
            "cwd": "/var/www/ng2.cooldomain.com",
            "args": "-p 8080 -d false",
            "script": "/root/.nvm/v4.2.6/bin/http-server"
        },
        {
            "name": "api",
            "cwd": "/var/www/api.cooldomain.com",
            "script": "app.js",
            "watch": true
        }
    ]
}
```

With all that out of the way I was finally able to test it all out:

```shell
pm2 start /path/to/process.json
```

## Wrap-up

I am happy everything is up and running, but please ping me with suggestions on improving my setup.  It's not like I'm running anything important, so a true production setup isn't required. However, I will say that I went through all this just to deploy a simple flash card game for my nine-year-old son. The app took me less than 30-minutes to write. The server setup and this post took me considerably longer.

[^fn-1]: Are apps _ever_ done?
[^fn-2]: I am sure I can add some more clever bits to do some caching and gzip'ing, but I have to save something to learn later.

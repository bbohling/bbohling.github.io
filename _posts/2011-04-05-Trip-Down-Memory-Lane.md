Surprisingly, I was in Aperture a bit tonight. I was migrating last month's photos from my MacBook Pro to our iMac (probably time for another photo workflow post) when I randomly thought about a photo trip Denise and I took back in 2002. About 12-15 of us from the Intel Arizona Photography Club (or something like that) took a trip in Northern Arizona. In two days we shot at Painted Desert, Canyon de Chelly, Glen Canyon, Antelope Canyon, and Monument Valley. Antelope Canyon and Monument Valley were two guided tours that were absolutely stellar. 

I spent about 30 minutes picking out the top photo from each shoot and performed some minor tweaks on each (minor curve adjustments and sharpened a couple of shots). I also included a group shot. I'm the one with the black-n-white stocking hat; Denise is next to me. All photos were taken with my original DSLR, the Canon EOS D30, a whopping 3.1 megapixel camera. The Canyon de Chelly photo was taken with a Canon 50mm f/1.4 lens; all the rest were taken with a Sigma 14mm f/2.8.

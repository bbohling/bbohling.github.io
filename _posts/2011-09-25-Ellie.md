![Ellie](/uploads/2011/09/Ellie.jpg)

This past Friday, almost 16 years to-the-day from our last time, we brought home a new puppy; a yellow English lab. We got her from Allison Hillius of [Devonshire Labradors][devonshire]. After spending a couple of days with her we have named her Ellie (after a landslide vote from friends and family). She just turned seven weeks old today so the next couple of weeks will be quite tiring as she will need constant supervision and let out to go potty every two to three hours. Pretty much like having another child I guess.

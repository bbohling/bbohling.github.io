Today there is no shortage of content to read. Even though I read at least two hours every day I feel like I can't keep up with my reading interests. Two hours is barely enough time to read my RSS feeds let alone any content I push off into [Instapaper][].

Reading list (traditional books/ebooks):

* [The Elements of Content Strategy][kissane] by Erin Kissane
* [Program or Be Programmed][rushkoff] by Douglas Rushkoff
* [Beautiful Architecture][spinellis] by Diomidis Spinellis
* [Growing Software][testa] by Louis Testa
* [Keeping it Straight][rhone] by Patrick Rhone
* [Do the Work][pressfield] by Steven Pressfield
* [Mindfulness in Plain English][mindful] by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana
* [Programming Ruby 1.9 (3rd edition): The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide][ruby] by Dave Thomas, with Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt
* [Metaprogramming Ruby: Program Like the Ruby Pros][meta] by Paolo Perrotta

And don't get me started on my time dilemma with podcasts!

I know that the root cause to my time problem is focus. I have so many interests that it is far too easy to get bogged down, so I am going to try the following techniques in an attempt to carve out more time to read from my queue:

* Go from reading 70 RSS feeds daily to just 4
* Only look at my Instapaper queue once a week and timebox: 1 hour
* Only sit down to watch any type of TV/movies twice a week: 4 hours max per week
* Don't purchase any more reading material; only add to my wishlist

I will try this new strategy for a month and see if I can make a dent in my reading queue. That will include a 10-day vacation so if I can't make any headway than maybe I have much deeper issues I need to address!

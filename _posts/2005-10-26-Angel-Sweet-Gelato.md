![Angel Sweet Gelato in Mesa Arizona](/uploads/2005/10/0620422427_200508_20d_10697.jpg)

Now that we will be leaving Arizona within four days we are hitting our favorite restaurants one last time. One of our favorite places to get dessert is Angel Sweet—we’ve been going there for a couple of years now and they are easily the best place to get gelato in the Phoenix area. Owned by an ASU grad, Hiro, I cannot remember the Italian company, but I do remember that it is the only one in the entire United States. If you are ever anywhere near Dobson and Chandler Blvd (Northeast corner)—you must stop in for some gelato…you won’t regret it. It will be one of the top ten restaurants we miss about Arizona!

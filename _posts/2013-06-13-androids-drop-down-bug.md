On and off for several days now I have been trying to fix an issue where a drop down list (`<select>` tag) seems to be disabled on old (version 2.x) Android devices. Apparently this is a [known bug][bug] with [plenty][selectBox] of [suggested][stack] [fixes][scott]. Not a single one (or combination) worked for me. I even came across [this suggestion][iscroll] since we are using [iScroll][iscrollCode], but it did not help either.

## What was my solution?

Wanting to rule out any jQuery or Knockout issues, I added a simple, hard-coded drop down above the one I was having issues with:

    <select>
        <option>One</option>
        <option>Two</option>
    </select> 

And to no surprise, it did not work...however, now my original drop box did work! Unfortunately I cannot explain it nor can I take the time right now to figure it out, but I thought I would share anyway.

Obviously I could not have a random drop down on the screen so I just hid it using the following:

    //CSS
    #oldAndroidSelectFix { left: -9999px; }

    // HTML
    <select id="oldAndroidSelectFix">
        <option>One</option>
        <option>Two</option>
    </select> 

If you run into this issue I encourage you to start with the official bug report: [Android Issue 10280: browser - inactive dropdowns][bug]. There are several steps to try before using a horrible hack like mine.

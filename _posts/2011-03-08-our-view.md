As I mentioned in a preview post, [How to Keep Your Husband Engaged in Furniture Decisions][furniture], one of my favorite features of our house is a gorgeous view of the [Coast Range][coast-range]. Sometime I will put together a series of shots taken throughout the year. In the meantime, here are two favorites just from last month.

The basic idea is this...at least once a week I will post a photo of something I interact with on an every day basis. Along with the photo I will include what that _thing_ means to me and/or why it is important. I’m sure this isn’t a unique project but I think it will be a wonderful exercise to focus my photography and writing passions. It will also expose my life in new ways. While I regularly reflect on my life, I take far too many things for granted.
 
So that’s the __My Everyday Things__ project. I kick it off next week. I welcome the one or two readers I have to bug me publicly on Twitter[^fn-1] if I go longer than seven days between posts.

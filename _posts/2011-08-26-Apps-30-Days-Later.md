In my previous post, [Apps I will install on New MacBook Air][air-apps], I highlight the apps that I intended on installing on my new MacBook Air. It has now been 30 days since I first laid hands on the new system, so what better time to report what I REALLY installed.

Before Dropbox it could take a couple of days to get a new computer set up with all of your goodies. Dropbox shaved off at least a few hours of data migration time, but this is the first time I have set up a new comptuer after using the Mac App Store. Wow. That's all I have to say, "Wow"! Within an hour I had my new system up and running with a good chunk of my apps. My guess is that next year when I replace our iMac that 80% of my apps will get installed with a click of a button. Sweet!

Below is a list of apps that I installed...in the order I installed them. In addition, I call out the apps I did not mention in my previous post.

## Installs

1. [Dropbox][] - I have a 50GB account so I used selective syncing as I did not want to potentially eat up 50GB with Dropbox data.
2. [1Password][]
3. [Aperture][]
4. [Transmit][]
5. [Alfred][]
6. [SuperDuper!][]
7. (NEW) [Secrets][] - preference pane for all those hidden OS settings
8. [Byword][]
9. [Reeder][]
10. (New)[Twitter][] - just had to use a client instead of the website
11. [TextExpander][]
12. [Final Cut Pro X][fcp]
13. (New) [Motion 5][motion] - bought in hopes of using during my vacation. However, I have yet to use it.
14. [Sparrow][]
15. (New) [Growl][] - forgot how much I couldn't live without an OS wide notification system
16. (New) [Geekbench][] - had to perform benchmark tests on all my Macs
17. (New) [Google Chrome][chrome] - still too many Flash-based content on the Web
18. [iA Writer][ia] - just couldn't resist 
19. [nvALT][] - so handy for jotting notes.
20. [Keyboard Maestro][km]
21. (New) [VLC][] - even on the small screen I find myself watching videos
22. [Marked][]
23. (New) [Tab for Google+][tab] - only slightly better client to Google+ than the website
23. [Textmate][]
